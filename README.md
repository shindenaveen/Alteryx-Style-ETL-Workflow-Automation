# Alteryx Workflow Automation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data workflow similar to Alteryx functionality using Python.  
The pipeline ingests a raw employee dataset, performs data validation and cleaning, applies basic summarization, and outputs clean data and summary reports.

The goal is to showcase capabilities aligned with a Senior Data Analytics Consultant role, including workflow automation, data validation, and reporting.
